This is an R Markdown document. We will show data from the gapminder dataset.

Below is a summary of the data:

```{r}
gap.in <- read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

summary(gap.in)
```

We are interested in GDP vs year for three countries: Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
UK.data <- gap.in[ which(gap.in$country=='United Kingdom'), ]
AU.data <- gap.in[ which(gap.in$country=='Australia'), ]
US.data <- gap.in[ which(gap.in$country=='United States'), ]

plot(gap.in$year,
     subset(gap.in, country=="United Kingdom"),
     xlab = "year", 
     ylab = "GDP per capita", 
     main = "GDP by year")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
